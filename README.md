This project explores how to connect to and interact with MySQL databases using Python. By leveraging the mysql-connector-python library, you can perform various database operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting records.

Key Concepts
Database Connection: Establish a connection to a MySQL database using credentials and connection parameters.
CRUD Operations: Execute SQL commands to Create, Read, Update, and Delete data.
Query Execution: Run SQL queries and handle results within Python scripts.
With these tools, I can integrate Python applications with MySQL databases, enabling dynamic data interaction and management.
